Cascading Style Sheets at the most basic level it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter. 


.class
#id
*          <!-- all elements -->
element    <!-- body is an element -->
element, element    <!-- both h2, p to have these properties -->
element element     <!-- h2 p, so all p's inside h2 will have this change -->
element > element   <!-- h2>p, so all p's with parent h2 will have this change -->
element + element   <!-- h2+p, p exactly after h2  -->
:hover     <!-- will only see item when you scroll mouse over -->
:last-child
:first-child
!important (not recommended)


What seletors win out in the cascade depends on:
-Specificity
-Importance
-Source Order
