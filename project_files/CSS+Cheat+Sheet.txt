Cascading Style Sheets at the most basic level it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter. 


.class     <!-- select a group of elements and ensure they all have the same style -->
#id        <!-- Only used once -->
*          <!-- For all elements (i.e move everything right), but can be changed later on-->
element    <!-- body is an element -->
element, element    <!-- both h2, p to have these properties -->
element element     <!-- h2 p, so all p's inside h2 will have this change -->
element > element   <!-- h2>p, so all p's with parent h2 will have this change -->
element + element   <!-- h2+p, p exactly after h2  -->
:hover     <!-- will only see item when you scroll mouse over -->
:last-child < 
:first-child
!important (not recommended) <!-- overrulles all orders, this command will not be changed -->


What selectors win out in the cascade depends on:
-Specificity <!-- how speicifc is your selector -->
-Importance
-Source Order

<!-- Amazing game to test selectors -->
